# Code of Conduct

We are committed to creating a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful community for all contributors. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants in the Flamingock Examples community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, gender expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that we deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

If you encounter behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by contacting the project maintainers. You can email us directly at [your email here], or reach out to us via the issue tracker or other communication channels provided by the repository.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
